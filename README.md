# Gamehub
This assignment was assigned by the U.C. Berkeley Extension Full-time Full Stack Flex Boot Camp.
This is the first major collaborative project assigned by the program. In this assignment our team was tasked to create a website that drew on multiple different APIs, used a CSS framework outside of the one we were taught in class, and used a Javascript library that we've never used before in class. The app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. It has a clean, polished, and responsive user interface.
